## A. Prefix and Suffix of List
The application tries to check whether the provided suffix or prefix satifies the given list or not by returning 'true' or 'false'.
### Prefix
When we look for the provided prefix it first split the list into the same length of the prefix as we have to check only those elements in a list and then it will check whether it is equal or not.
